- **Performance Optimization**: Hardware-accelerated transforms and efficient repainting strategies

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with HTML5 and CSS3 support
- JavaScript enabled
- Web Audio API support (for sound effects)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone or Download**: Obtain the project files
2. **File Structure**: Ensure the following directory structure:
   ```
   roulette-game/
   ├── index.html
   ├── css/
   │   └── style.css
   └── js/
       └── game.js
   ```
3. **Local Server**: For optimal performance, serve files through a local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
4. **Access**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser

### Direct File Access
The application can also be run by directly opening `index.html` in a web browser, though some features may be limited due to CORS restrictions.

## Game Mechanics

### Betting Rules
- **Minimum Bet**: $1 per betting spot
- **Maximum Total Bet**: Limited by current balance
- **Multiple Bets**: Players can place multiple bets on different spots simultaneously
- **Bet Validation**: System prevents over-betting and invalid bet amounts

### Payout Structure
Following European Roulette standards:
- **Single Number**: 35:1 (pays 35 plus original bet)
- **Red/Black, Even/Odd, 1-18/19-36**: 1:1
- **Dozens (1-12, 13-24, 25-36)**: 2:1
- **Columns**: 2:1

### Wheel Mechanics
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Realistic Timing**: 4-second spin duration with authentic deceleration
- **Visual Accuracy**: Numbers positioned according to European wheel layout

## User Interface Design

### Visual Design Philosophy
The interface employs a modern casino aesthetic with:
- **Color Scheme**: Deep blue gradient background with gold accents
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with appropriate sizing hierarchy
- **Layout**: Grid-based responsive design with logical information grouping
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between primary actions and secondary information

### Accessibility Features

## Audio System

### Web Audio API Implementation
The game utilizes the Web Audio API for superior audio performance and control:

- **Oscillator-Based Sounds**: Procedurally generated audio effects
- **Dynamic Frequency Modulation**: Realistic wheel spinning sounds with decreasing frequency
- **Gain Control**: Precise volume management and fade effects
- **Context Management**: Proper audio context initialization and cleanup

### Sound Design
